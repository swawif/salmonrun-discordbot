# SalmonRun-DiscordBot
A salmon run bot for discord that post salmon run's schedules in chat using Discord.js and Node.JS by parsing JSON API's from splatoon2.ink, licensed under the GNU GPL v3

## USAGE

!salmon : 

Replies with the current or the next salmonrun schedule



!nextsalmon : 

Replies with the next available salmonrun schedule

## Installation

Ensure you have Node.js, npm, and PM2 Installed 

1. download file and then unzip into some folder.
2. rename the 'config-example.json' to 'config.json'
3. in the 'config.json' replace the "supersecretkey" to your discord bot's key
4. run 'npm install' (to install any dependencies that might get lost)
5. type on your command prompt 'pm2 start server.js' (we are using PM2 so that the bot will run on the background, even if the CMD/terminal window is closed)
6. ???
7. profit (I Think...)
8. now the bot will run automagically on the background.



## DISCLAIMER

THIS BOT IS MADE BY A TOTAL AMATEUR.

If this bot break your stuff (unlikely) and take down the whole internet with it (highly-unlikely), I cannot be responsible for it

Also if it doesn't work, most of the time I do not know how to fix it. So don't bother contacting me. google is your best friend (because that's how I debug most of my code). But so far it works alright

this bot is primarily made to train my coding skills. also to replace the now unmaintained "R. Danny" bot (the salmon run part has yet to be updated until the time of writing, 9th July 2018)
